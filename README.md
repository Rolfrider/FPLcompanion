App for Fantasy Premier League coach

It's my side project and i'm doing it for fun. Also I want to learn something new.
If u would like to help or review my code, feel free to write to me.
I divided work into 3 steps.
Here are the steps:

1. Gathering  and presenting the data about players.(I'm in this step)
  Saving data in local database(sqLite) and presenting it in Gui.
2. Provaiding some analysis, that helps improve your team.
  I not sure yet how to do it, but I will find out.
3. A attempt to move app to mobile.
